I'm Tucker Triggs, a website developer based in Boulder, Colorado, USA. I create websites and solve problems for businesses using web technologies.

I have a BA in Political Science from Eckerd College. After graduating I became captivated by the creativity and challenge of web development. To further my knowledge I spent 6 months in Galvanize bootcamp where we building full-stack web applications with JavaScript. Since then I have been working with individual clients and small businesses (often remotely) to deliver their dream websites. 

Besides the web, some things I enjoy are hiking mountains, reading, cooking, exploring craft beer, and travel (I've been to 40+ countries).
